Hey ninjas! I'm [@ghsioux](https://github.com/ghsioux) and I'm working as a solution engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/). This blog will mainly be used to share some experiments and stories along this journey.

GitHub is a powerful and constantly evolving platform, mastering it is like reaching the peak of the mountain! The work presented here comes from my personal understanding of it. All the opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of GitHub.

Some other random points about the work/repos I'll share here:
* it's way more for experiments / proofs of concept rather than for production-ready environments;
* if you look at the commits history and you're a Git-purist, be ready, it's generally a mess.. I know that I should write [better commits](https://github.blog/2022-06-30-write-better-commits-build-better-projects/#writing-better-commits) but hey, maybe one day 😶‍🌫️

Anyway, hope you'll enjoy, see ya in the ♾️
